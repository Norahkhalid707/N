# Aerospace, Math, and Physics Lab

This space documents independent projects exploring aerospace systems, applied mathematics, and fundamental physics.

## Focus Areas
- Flight dynamics and control systems
- Aerospace signal processing and instrumentation
- Classical mechanics and electromagnetism
- Applied mathematics for engineering (linear algebra, differential equations, Laplace transforms)

## Goals
To investigate and simulate real-world systems using scientific methods, mathematical modeling, and engineering tools.

## Current Projects
Coming soon:
- Simulation of a basic flight control system
- Physics-based model of a falling body with drag
- Signal filtering using Laplace and Fourier methods
