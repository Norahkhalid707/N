# Aerospace, Math, and Physics Lab

I'm a student of Aerospace Electronic Engineering, building a personal portfolio of projects that combine aerospace systems, physics, and applied mathematics.

## Focus Areas
- Flight dynamics and control systems
- Aerospace signal processing and instrumentation
- Classical mechanics and electromagnetism
- Applied mathematics for engineering (linear algebra, differential equations, Laplace transforms)

## Goals
To build the mindset and skills of a scientist through independent projects, simulations, and experiments â€” even beyond formal education.

## Current Projects
Coming soon: 
- A simple flight system model
- Physics-based simulation of a falling body with air resistance
- Signal filtering using Laplace transform concepts
